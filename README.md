# UDP-Messenger
UDP Messenger written in Rust

This project is an example of a simple UDP messenger between a server & client.
The server folder contains a project that enables a user to input text which is then sent to the client.
The client recieves this data and adds additional text to the end of the input and returns the input to the sender.
The server then displays the message.


TODO: 
- Enable error handling on recieving data (catch buffer overflows, etc)
